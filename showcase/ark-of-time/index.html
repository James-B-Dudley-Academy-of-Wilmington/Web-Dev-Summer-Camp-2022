    <p>The weapon system is going to make it so that you can loot bosses for weapons and armor and maybe some potions.<br/>
     you can also by them from a trader or the market and if you have the right materials you can even make weapons!<br/>
     you can sharpen worn out weapons and even enchanted them! </p>

    <p>Some of the boss fights will not be open to you if you are not a high enough level.<br/>
     Their is also going to be a mutiplayer which you can join with friends.<br/>
     you can also play local mutiplayer if you want to play with your friends in a group to fight bosses together.  </p>
